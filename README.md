### ABOUT

The Project is a simple search CLI across multiple json files along with the ability to
search for a specific json file with available fields. The project has the scope
to add more classes (inheritance) and also more test cases to cover different scenarios.
But for this exercise, I have limited the usage.

### RUNNING THE PROGRAM

To run the script, activate the venv and install the `requirements.txt` and then:

`python3 zendesk.py`

### RUNNING THE TESTS

To the run the tests:

`python3 test.py`

### AUTO PEP-8/LINTERS

I have used black for auto indenting and following PEP-8 standards and the linter used
to highlight any irregularities, I have used flake8 with an exception to ignore long line
error, E501.
